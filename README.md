# js-util

This package isn't for you. But you can use it.

It was created to hold just a few utility functions, & to keep app bloat and file count down.

It's nothing special.

If you're looking for a generic util solution consider 
[lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash), a more complete
and better tested util library.
